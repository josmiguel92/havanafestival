--------------

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

3 Editing this theme
------------------

The Cubapoesia theme consists of:

- Homepage (index.twig)
- Record page (record.twig)
- Listing page (listing.twig)

You can edit these files to your liking. The themes come with the development build of Tailwind CSS which is 2380.4kB.
These makes the development as productive as possible, but when you are ready for production, make sure you 'purge' the CSS.
See the Tailwind documentation for information about [controling the file size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size).

  ```
**Important note**
In the folder "tailwind css" is the base css file for generating the Tailwind CSS.
In this file are also some custom CSS rules for the record template.
